# LLM:LEARNING-CROSS-MODALITY-PERSON-RE-IDENTIFICATION-VIA-LOW-RANK-LOCAL-MATCHING
Code for paper " LLM:LEARNING-CROSS-MODALITY-PERSON-RE-IDENTIFICATION-VIA-LOW-RANK-LOCAL-MATCHING"

Requirments:
pytorch: 0.4.1(the higher version may lead to performance fluctuation)

torchvision: 0.2.1

numpy: 1.17.4

python: 3.7

Dataset :SYSU-MM01, Reg-DB

LLM approach model of SYSU-MMO1 in:  https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ecXnB3Rhl2xQWZ2y-3HoIQ, code is ocjz .

This code largely benefits from following repositories: https://github.com/mangye16/Cross-Modal-Re-ID-baseline and https://github.com/zhanghang1989/PyTorch-Encoding .I am very grateful to the author (@mangye16) and (@zhanghang1989)for his contribution and help.
